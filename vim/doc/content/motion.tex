\subsection{text object selection}
This is a series of commands that can only be used while in Visual mode or
after an operator.  The commands that start with "a" select "a"n object
including white space, the commands starting with "i" select an "inner" object
without white space, or just the white space.  Thus the "inner" commands
always select less text than the "a" commands. \\

%%			"a quoted string".  Selects the text from the previous
%%			quote until the next quote.  The 'quoteescape' option
%%			is used to skip escaped quotes.
%%			Only works within one line.
%%			When the cursor starts on a quote, Vim will figure out
%%			which quote pairs form a string by searching from the
%%			start of the line.
%%			Any trailing white space is included, unless there is
%%			none, then leading white space is included.
%%			When used in Visual mode it is made characterwise.
%%			Repeating this object in Visual mode another string is
%%			included.  A count is currently not used.

%%			Like a", a' and a`, but exclude the quotes and
%%			repeating won't extend the Visual selection.
%%			Special case: With a count of 2 the quotes are
%%			included, but no extra white space as with a"/a'/a`.
%%
%%When used after an operator:
%%For non-block objects:
%%	For the "a" commands: The operator applies to the object and the white
%%	space after the object.  If there is no white space after the object
%%	or when the cursor was in the white space before the object, the white
%%	space before the object is included.
%%	For the "inner" commands: If the cursor was on the object, the
%%	operator applies to the object.  If the cursor was on white space, the
%%	operator applies to the white space.
%%For a block object:
%%	The operator applies to the block where the cursor is in, or the block
%%	on which the cursor is on one of the braces.  For the "inner" commands
%%	the surrounding braces are excluded.  For the "a" commands, the braces
%%	are included.
%%
%%When used in Visual mode:
%%When start and end of the Visual area are the same (just after typing "v"):
%%	One object is selected, the same as for using an operator.
%%When start and end of the Visual area are not the same:
%%	For non-block objects the area is extended by one object or the white
%%	space up to the next object, or both for the "a" objects.  The
%%	direction in which this happens depends on which side of the Visual
%%	area the cursor is.  For the block objects the block is extended one
%%	level outwards.
